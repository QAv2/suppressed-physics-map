        "description": "QA reframes the disclosure map's central findings:\n\nThe documented patterns — intelligence blackmail operations, media narrative control, financial network obfuscation, regulatory capture — are all forms of Consensus Space manipulation.\n\nPhase-locking manipulation: Controlling what observers phase-lock to (media-propaganda, media-entertainment) controls which aspects of Consensus Space become \"real\" for the population.\n\nDistinction corruption: When institutions invert language (ritual-inversion), they corrupt observers' distinction-making capacity, effectively reducing C_max for political purposes.\n\nThe disclosure map documents HOW institutional power operates. QA reveals the consciousness-level mechanism: controlling the observer's access to accurate distinctions.\n\n🟠 This is interpretive framework, not documented fact\n🟢 The institutional patterns it explains are documented throughout the disclosure map",
