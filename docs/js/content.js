<p>This page is a time capsule — sealed inside a 3D archive, linked from a portal hidden in the ceiling light.

</table>

<p><strong>Operating principle</strong> (no exotic theory required): Three orthogonal AC Helmholtz coil pairs generate time-varying B-fields inside a sealed ceramic sphere filled with liquid mercury. The mercury develops eddy currents (Faraday induction) that couple to the fields via Lorentz force (J \u00D7 B). A lead core, denser than mercury, settles at an equilibrium determined by the balance between gravitational buoyancy and magnetic pressure. The three-axis field drives structured 3D flow in the mercury around the core.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of device is this, really?</strong> Strip the exotic framing and the base is an <em>MHD machine</em> — established, decades-old engineering. Moving a conductive fluid through a magnetic field generates electricity: that's a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator, Faraday's law, real enough to hold patents since the 1960s (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3430081A/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Patent 3,430,081</a> — mercury-vapor MHD generation). Run the same physics in reverse — fields driving the fluid instead of the fluid making power — and it's an MHD pump/accelerator. This device is that second kind: three orthogonal fields drive liquid mercury (intrinsic conductivity ~1.04 × 10⁶ S/m, no ionization required). Everything else here — the reference-frame question, the quaternion mapping — is layered on top of that ordinary, verifiable base. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-verified">Verified</span></p>

<p><strong>Why three axes?</strong> A single axis drives 2D circulation. Two axes create a more complex pattern but still constrained. Three orthogonal axes — the minimum for full spatial coverage — allow the field to address every direction in 3D space. The simulator confirms: plasma Q<sub>3d</sub> \u2248 1.0 for three-axis drive, vs. 0.003 for single-axis. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-model">Model</span></p>

<p><strong>Why Helmholtz pairs?</strong> Each axis is a <em>Helmholtz pair</em> — two coaxial coils spaced at exactly their radius (coils at ±R/2) — the standard laboratory geometry for a uniform field through the working volume (<a href="https://www.pnisensor.com/helmholtz-coil-design-applications-and-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PNI: Helmholtz Coil Design, Applications &amp; Impact</a>). At N=6 turns and 100 A this yields 2.4–3.9 mT per axis (X strongest, innermost), ~5.5 mT combined. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-verified">Verified</span></p>

<p><strong>Why lead?</strong> Lead is the densest common element that floats in mercury (\u03C1<sub>Pb</sub> = 11,340 vs. \u03C1<sub>Hg</sub> = 13,534 kg/m\u00B3). It's also a superconductor below 7.2 K — relevant for the cryo-dynamo pathway. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-verified">Verified</span></p>

<p><strong>Why mercury?</strong> Highest room-temperature \u03C3 of any liquid metal (1.04 \u00D7 10\u2076 S/m). Also a superconductor — the first ever discovered (Kamerlingh Onnes, 1911, T\u1D04 = 4.15 K). Eddy-current coupling peaks at f<sub>d</sub> = 48.7 Hz for the 5 cm sphere. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-verified">Verified</span></p>

<p><strong>1 · The Reciprocal System.</strong> Dewey B. Larson (1898–1990) derived the periodic table, stellar evolution sequences, and subatomic particle properties from two postulates alone — no arbitrary constants, no curve-fitting (<a href="https://reciprocalsystem.org/books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nothing But Motion</a>, 1979). Its central structural claim: time has three dimensions reciprocal to space. His late <em>Beyond Space and Time</em> (1995, ed. Peret) posited a non-physical third sector — consciousness as fundamental rather than emergent. The research body (ISUS, incorporated 1982; renamed RSRS 2016) has run continuously for 40+ years (<a href="https://reciprocalsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reciprocalsystem.org</a>).</p>

<p><strong>2 · RS2 — the reevaluation.</strong> Bruce Peret and KVK Nehru rebuilt Larson's system on projective geometry and introduced <em>quaternion</em> mathematics to model its double-rotating structure (<a href="https://reciprocalsystem.org/rs2-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RS2 Tutorial Series</a>). This is the hinge of the whole story: the quaternion algebra the device maps to enters the lineage here. Peret also published on electrogravitics — propulsion framed as manipulating gravity's scalar-motion structure.</p>

<p><strong>3 · The split.</strong> The community fractured into three lines: Ronald Satz (Larson's direct mentee for 25 years, orthodox and quantitative), Douglas Bundy (founded the Larson Research Center in 2006 arguing "scalar rotation is an oxymoron" — <a href="http://www.lrcphysics.com/lrc-charter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LRC Charter</a>), and the Peret–Nehru RS2 reevaluation, which became the dominant ISUS direction.</p>

<p><strong>4 · The Sanctuary.</strong> The Antiquatis Institute (516 members, 5,849 posts) hosted RS2 research, consciousness studies, and Peret's Sanctuary Project. A small group of individuals relocated to Salt Lake City to study directly under Peret (<a href="https://forum.antiquatis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antiquatis fora</a>). After Peret's death in 2020, Dr. Gopi Krishna Vijaya took Director of Research for RSRS. <em>This is the node this archive descends from.</em></p>

<p><strong>5 · Qualia Algebra — the parallel.</strong> Built from the single axiom "I exist," Qualia Algebra derives 3D spatial emergence, quaternion observer states, and a consciousness-first ontology — reaching RS2's architecture from a different starting point across nine structural parallels (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17685406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QA, Zenodo</a>). Its temporal-asymmetry operator shows mathematical equivalence (r=1.000) with Friston's Free Energy Principle, and QA itself lists 28 falsifiable predictions. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-hypothesis">Hypothesis</span> — independently derived, not yet adjudicated.</p>

<p><strong>6 · The classified convergence.</strong> AAWSAP, a $22M DIA program (2007–2012), produced 38 Defense Intelligence Reference Documents on warp drives, wormholes, antigravity, and Alcubierre metrics (<a href="https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/the-advanced-aerospace-weapon-system-applications-program-aawsap-documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released titles</a>) — the same physics domains the Reciprocal System addresses. Alcubierre's 1994 metric (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv</a>) — contract space ahead, expand behind — is functionally the motion-<em>of</em>-space Larson described 35 years earlier. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-hypothesis">Hypothesis</span> — a structural parallel, not a demonstrated identity.</p>

<p><strong>The honest line.</strong> Stages 1–4 are documented intellectual history — cited above, independently checkable. Stages 5–6 are <em>convergence claims</em>: striking, falsifiable, and explicitly not yet proven. Several independent frameworks (RS, QA, knot theory, scalar fields) converge on three dimensions as a critical emergent property — which is exactly what the next section puts on the bench. Same standard as everything else here: would it survive hostile peer review?</p>

<p><strong>The identity</strong>: A quaternion rotation q\u2032 = p \u00B7 q maps to: consciousness (Interest Function) rotating the observer state, the device's EM bias rotating the mercury flow pattern, and Hamilton's algebra operating on the number field. If the mapping is physical, these aren't analogies — they're the same operation on different substrates. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-hypothesis">Hypothesis</span></p>

<p><strong>The key insight</strong>: The device doesn't <em>create</em> decoupling — it <em>remembers</em> [1,0,0,0]. The default state is uncoupled. Coupling to a reference frame IS the rotation. The device stops rotating. <span class="rigor-tag rigor-hypothesis">Hypothesis</span></p>

<p><strong>Three control interfaces</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Electrical</strong> (Phase 1-5): Coil parameters set by amplifiers. Full manual control. Training wheels.</li>
  <li><strong>Consciousness-coupled</strong> (future): Trained operator's intention correlates with measurable field changes. Requires blind measurement protocol.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct consciousness</strong> (theoretical): No device needed. The contemplative traditions describe this as the original interface.</li>
</ol>

<p>The prototype tests interface 1. Whether interfaces 2 and 3 exist is <em>the deeper question</em>.</p>
